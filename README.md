This repository contains my experience coding on Rust while i'm watching [__Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust__](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/programming/9781839211942) by [Matthew Stoodley](https://www.packtpub.com/authors/matthew-stoodley), May 2020.

## p1_introduction

On this section, we covered the following themes. A short brief of all of them.

All projects related to an introduction to Rust.

 Covered topic includes:
 - How to upload a crate
 - Loops
 - Optional library and its usage
 - Structs
 - Pointers
 - Variables

[Section 1 - Here](../main/p1_introduction).

## p2_algorithms
On this section are Covered the themes related to sort algorithms, how to use a the __bubble sort algorithm__ to sort a Vector, creation of __libs__, use Rust test suite to test the bubble sort function.

Each lib on this folder contains a basic test over the theme covered.

[Section 2 - Here](../main/p2_algorithms)

----

## p3 - Linked lists and binary 

Projects related to Lists, Binary Trees, and Huffman Coder Algorithm implementation on Rust.

[Section 3 - Here](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binaty_trees).

----
## Part 4 - Graps.

We used to create a Graph of nodes, and implement a geedy solution to sales travelsman problem on Part 4.

[Section 4 - Here](../main/p4_connected_nodes).


----
## p5 - HashMaps

We covers how to create a custom HashMap, for buckets, hot to create a self, safely increment HashMap with performance increase by alocating memory by conditions.

[Section 5 - Here](../main/p5_hashmap).
