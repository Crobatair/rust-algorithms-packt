# rust-algorithms-packt

This repository contains my experience coding on Rust while i'm watching [__Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust__](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/programming/9781839211942) by [Matthew Stoodley](https://www.packtpub.com/authors/matthew-stoodley), May 2020.

Feel free to contribute or clone this project. Any suggestion or comment is welcome.

### p1_introduction

> All projects related to an introduction to Rust.

 Covered topic includes:
 - How to upload a crate
 - Loops
 - Optional library and its usage
 - Structs
 - Pointers
 - Variables

### p2_algorithms
> On this section are Covered the themes related to sort algorithms, how to use a the __bubble sort algorithm__ to sort a Vector, creation of __libs__, use Rust test suite to test the bubble sort function.

>Each lib on this folder contains a basic test over the theme covered.

Covered Themes:
- [Bubble Sort](../main/p2_algorithms/v1-sorting/src/lib.rs)
- [Sort by batch of 2](../main/p2_algorithms/v2-merge-sort/src/lib.rs)
- [Quick Sort algorithm, with pivot](../main/p2_algorithms/v3-quick-sort/src/lib.rs)
- [Quick Sort Algorithm, with random Pivot generated by static module](../main/p2_algorithms/v4-improve-sort/src/lib.rs)
  - created a random number generator with a random seed generation
  - std::rs::Rs [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html)
  - lazy_static [here](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static)
- [Quick Sort with Rand Pivot - __std Multi Threads__](../main/p2_algorithms/v5-sort-threads/src/lib.rs)
- [Quick Sort With Rand Pivot - __Rayon Thread Pool__](../main/p2_algorithms/v6-thread-pool/src/lib.rs)
  - Rayon crate... [Here](https://crates.io/crates/rayon)
- [Fibonacci algorithm with Tail Recursive Dynamic Programming](../main/p2_algorithms/v7-dynamic-programming/src/main.rs)
  - Added a timmer to log the performance between different algorithms to calculate [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
  - Dynamic Programming Definition [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
  - Tail Recursive [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)

### p3 - Linked lists and binary 

> Projects related to Lists, Binary Trees, and Huffman Coder Algorithm implementation on Rust.

- [Linked Lists](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v1_linked_lists/src/main.rs)
- [Double Linked Lists](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v2_double_linked_lists/src/main.rs)
- [Binary Trees](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v4_binary_trees/src/main.rs)
- [Balance Binary Trees](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v5_balance_binary_tree/src/main.rs)
- [Skip lists](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v6_skip_lists/src/main.rs)
  - Print list elements as custom std::fmt::Display
- [Huffman coder](../main/p3_linked_lists_and_binary_trees/v7_huffman_encodign/src/main.rs)
  - [Huffman coder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) implementation.
  - From a string, builds a Huffman Coder.
  - As Assignment, is added an method to decode an encoded string.
  - As extra, has been added a method to get all encoded chars.
