# Information related to Graphs.


This module contains information related to how to build a node graph on Rust.

The follow image taken from Course and it used on all chapter.

In [v1_graphs_connected_nodes](../../main/p4_connected_nodes/v1_graphs_connected_nodes/src/main.rs), contains different method to implement a Graph using different techniques in Rust.


On [v2_graphs](../../main/p4_connected_nodes/v2_graphs/src/main.rs) its implemented a graph on pointer based.
Implemented a basic add node, and add edge methods.

On [v3_router_structure](../../main/p4_connected_nodes/v3_router_structure/src/main.rs) moved err to a module and added a test to test if new Err class, instance, contains a mess with asserteq on message.
Also,  created a trait for i32 and impl trait.
