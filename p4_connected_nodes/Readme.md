# Information related to Graphs.


This module contains information related to how to build a node graph on Rust.

In [v1_graphs_connected_nodes](../../main/p4_connected_nodes/v1_graphs_connected_nodes/src/main.rs), contains different method to implement a Graph using different techniques in Rust.


On [v2_graphs](../../main/p4_connected_nodes/v2_graphs/src/main.rs) its implemented a graph on pointer based.
Implemented a basic add node, and add edge methods.
